# Huawei Status Monitor for OSX

This is a basic status icon that displays the signal level, and some other info for Huawei E5331, it may work on others I don't know and haven't tested.

I knew nothing about Objective-C before writing this (and still don't), but really wanted something that did this so gave it a go!

Cheers
